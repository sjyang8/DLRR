# DLRR
 DLRR
The code is for the work: 
[1] S.-J. Yang J.-H. Hou , Y.-H. Jia, S.-H. Mei, Q. Du. Superpixel Induced Discriminative Low rank Representation of Hyperspectral Images. Oct 2021, In: IEEE Transactions on Image 
Processing (TIP)
1)  Get Started: 
For DLRR,  you can call the "Call_DLRR_single_test_indian_data" function to run the algorithm for Indian_pines dataset. You can also choose to call the "Call_DLRR_single_test_paviau_data" 
or "Call_DLRR_single_test_salinas_data" functions for other two datasets. After above procedure, you can see the on-screen instructions for showing the result, such as 
â€œthe performance for this time: OA=*,AA=*,Kappa=*". 

Dependancies:
1)Entropy Rate Superpixel Segmentation
2)MATLAB toolboxes on my PC that you may need:
-----------Deep Learning Toolbox
-----------Image Processing Toolbox
-----------Mapping Toolbox
-----------Optimization Toolbox
-----------Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
-----------Symbolic Math Toolbox
