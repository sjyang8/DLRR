	                   Readme for the DLRR Package
	 		       version Oct 13, 2021
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package includes the MATLAB code of the DLRR algorithm in the paper "Superpixel-guided Discriminative Low-rank Representation of Hyperspectral Images for Classification" [1].

Processing (TIP)

1)  Get Started
For DLRR,  you can call the "Call_DLRR_single_test_indian_data" function to run the algorithm for Indian_pines dataset. You can also choose to call the "Call_DLRR_single_test_paviau_data" 
or "Call_DLRR_single_test_salinas_data" functions for other two datasets. After the above procedure, you can see the on-screen instructions for showing the result, such as 
â€œthe performance for this time: OA=*,AA=*,Kappa=*". 

2). Details

For DLRR,  the "Call_DLRR_single_test_indian_data" will automatically create a new folder for saving the detailed results,  i.e. "Indian_pines_results/Indian_pinesper_class0.05each_iter/". In such a folder, 
for example, the result file "Indian_pines_train1_iters3_result_svm.mat" saves the results for 3rd learning iteration of 1th run.  In the following, we also show a detailed description of the 
variables that are stored in the result file.

Variable description:
accuracy_SVM1 	-------- 	OA on the original feature
accuracy_SVM2  	-------- 	OA on the denoising feature by DLRR
Kappa_SVM1     	--------	Kappa on the original feature
Kappa_SVM2    	--------	Kappa on the denoising feature by DLRR
TPR_SVM1         	--------	Accuracy of each class on the original feature
TPR_SVM2  	--------    Accuracy of each class on the denoising feature by DLRR
Predict_SVM1	--------	The prediction on the original feature
Predict_SVM2	--------	The prediction on the denoising feature by DLRR
para		--------	The parameters
ori_num_pixel	--------    The original number of superpixels 
num_superpixel 	--------	The updated number of superpixels by DLRR
CTrain		--------	The number of samples on each class for training data
CTest 		--------	The number of samples on each class for testing data
loc_train		--------	The positions of training samples
loc_test		--------	The positions of testing samples
