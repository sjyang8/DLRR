	                   Readme for the DLRR Package
	 		       version Oct 13, 2021
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package includes the MATLAB code of the DLRR algorithm in paper "Superpixel-guided Discriminative Low-rank Representation of Hyperspectral Images for Classification" [1].

Processing (TIP)

1)  Get Started
For DLRR,  you can call the "Call_DLRR_single_test_indian_data" function to run the algorithm for Indian_pines dataset. You can also choose to call the "Call_DLRR_single_test_paviau_data" 
or "Call_DLRR_single_test_salinas_data" functions for other two datasets. After above procedure, you can see the on-screen instructions for showing the result, such as 
â€œthe performance for this time: OA=*,AA=*,Kappa=*". 

2). Details

For DLRR,  the "Call_DLRR_single_test_indian_data" will automatically create a new folder for saving the detailed results,  i.e. "Indian_pines_results/Indian_pinesper_class0.05each_iter/". In such folder, 
for example, the result file "Indian_pines_train1_iters3_result_svm.mat" saves the results for 3rd learning iteration of 1th run.  In the following, we also show the detailed description for the 
variables that stored in the result file.

Variable description:
accuracy_SVM1 ---------OA on original feature
accuracy_SVM2 ---------OA on denosing feature by DLRR
Kappa_SVM1 ------------Kappa on original feature
Kappa_SVM2-------------Kappa on denosing feature by DLRR
